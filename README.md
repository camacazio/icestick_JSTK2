# icestick_JSTK2
This uses the Lattice Semi ICESTICK board and the PMOD JSTK2. It cycles colors on the PMOD RGB light and it reads the joystick position to light the cross-pattern LEDs on the ICESTICK board. See the contraint file for which pins the PMOD connects. Additional code is for the PMOD_OLED module. I couldn't get it to compile on the APIO environment for ICESTICK board. However, it is tested and works with CMOD A7 board. On the CMOD A7 board, the colors cycled on the joystick also reflect on the RGB LED on the CMOD, and the joystick position is reflected on the OLED screen.
